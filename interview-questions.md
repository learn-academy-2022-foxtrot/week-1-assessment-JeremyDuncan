# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as 
if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to 
answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have 
answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. 
Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: 
* Git is a version control system created by Linus Torvalds who
happens to be the creater of Linux too. It is essentially a super save state 
used in software development, which is used to keep track of changes to 
codebase and allows developers to go back to a previous 'save' in case there
are problems with the codebase.

* Github is one of many formats that can be used with Git. You can utilize Git 
and Github together to share a codebase in the cloud. This allows developers to
easily share and collaborate with other developers.

Researched answer:
* According to: https://git-scm.com/, Git is a free and open source distrubuted 
version control system designed to handle small to large projects quickly and
efficiently. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 is a free online book that provides
a plethora of information with everything git.

* According to: https://kinsta.com/knowledgebase/what-is-github/, Github is a 
website and cloud-based service that provides devolopers a way to store and 
manage code.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: 
* Javascript operators that will return a Boolean value include
'< <= > >= == === ! && || != !=='
examples:
```javascript
(3 > 2)             // true
(3 < 2)             // false
(3 === 2)           // false
(3 !== 2)           // true
(3 > 2 && 2 > 3)    // false
(3 > 2 || 2 > 3)    // true
(3 >= 3 && 2 >= 2)  // true
```

Researched answer: 
* According to: 
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators#comparison_operators, 
the following operators '< <= > >= == === ! && || != !==' are refered to as 
comparison operators. They compare its operands and return a logical value 
based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be Numerical, string, 
logical, or object values.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: 
* An index is a location reference used in arrays and strings. JavaScript uses a
zero based index system, meaning it starts the index at 0. An index number can 
be stored in a variable as well to make understanding the code easier, and other 
situations such as going through an array during a loop where the index needs
to change every loop.  

* The difference between index and value is that you use the index to find the 
value. 

Example:
```javascript
arr = ["Cat", "Dog", "Rabbit"];
arr[0] // index: 0, value: "Cat"
arr[1] // index: 1, value: "Dog"
arr[2] // index: 2, value: "Rabbit" 
```
Researched answer:
* According to: 
https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-arrays-in-javascript#indexing-arrays, 
Arrays do not have name/value pairs. Instead, they are indexed with integer 
values beginning with 0.
* According to: https://www.educba.com/javascript-values/, JavaScript values are 
the values that comprise values like Booleans, Strings, arrays, and numbers.
